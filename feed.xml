        <title>SLAE Problem 1: TCP Bind Shell Shellcode</title>
        <description>From my experience playing around with socket programming in C and Python, there is a basic formula and group of function calls for creating clients and servers. Most of them will be useful to us. A couple won't be applicable to our situation.</description>

        <title>Using Clj-http When A Web App Has CSRF Protection</title>
        <description>Recently when working on a Clojure web app I ran into a scenario where I wanted to do a little bit of integration testing. What I wanted to do was post some data to the same endpoint that my webform would post to. The problem was that the app used ring-anti-forgery for CSRF protection. Because of this, I needed to figure out a way to spoof this anti-forgery token when making POST requests using Clj-http. The solution came out of a lot of trial and error.</description>

        <title>5 Great Experiences While Learning Clojure</title>
        <description>Lately I have been exploring functional programming and have been spending a lot of time working with Clojure.  As I spend more and more time with it I find that there are particular aspects of the language that I find beautiful and enjoyable.  Some of these aspects come from the fact that Clojure is a LISP dialect of programming language.  Other aspects come from the fact that Clojure is a functional language.  Here are 5 great experiences I have had while learning the language:</description>

        <title>RailsConf 2014</title>
        <description>Today wrapped up RailsConf 2014 in Chicago, Illinois and I have to say that it was quite a good time.  This was my first RailsConf and it definitely lived up to its reputation.  From DHH trolling that TDD is nonsense in his Keynote speech to Tenderlove making a live merge of the &quot;AdequateRecord&quot; branch into Rails master it was never a dull moment.</description>

        <title>Ruby Dir &quot;Random&quot; on Linux but Alphabetical on OSX</title>
        <description>Recently after a co-worker pushed code to our continuous integration server Jenkins was saying that the build was broken and that a constant was being called that wasn’t initialized. What was strange is that the code my co-worker pushed ran just fine when I ran it on my work Mac Laptop as well as some of my other co-workers Mac Laptops. This has to be some sort of weird Mac / Linux difference.</description>

        <title>Associations in ActiveRecord &quot;not&quot;</title>
        <description>While working with Rails 4 today I was attempting to use the new .not method of ActiveRecord. This method is similar to the jQuery .not method as it allows you to filter your result set where a particular attribute of your result does NOT match what you pass in as .not’s argument. The syntax is:</description>
