<p>This year RailsConf was a tracked conference so I didn’t get a chance to see every talk although I look forward to catching the recordings on <a href="http://rubycentral.org/railsconf">Ruby Central</a> as soon as they are released.  Some of my favorite talks included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the Little Things by: Sandi Metz</li>
  <li>The “Rails of JavaScript” won’t be a Framework by: Justin Searls</li>
  <li>Cognitive Shortcuts: Models, Visualizations, Metaphors, and Other Lies by: Sam Livingston-Gray</li>
  <li>Debugger Driven Development with Pry by: Joel Turnbull</li>
  <li>Eliminating Inconsistent Test Failures by: Austin Putman</li>
  <li>An Ode to 17 Databases in 33 minutes by: Toby Hede</li>
  <li>Secrets of a World Memory Champion by: Chris Hunt</li>
  <li>Middleman: The missing front end of the Rails API stack by: Brad Gessler</li>
</ul>

<p>These talks were all very informative and some of them quite humorous and entertaining.  “Baratunde Thurston’s”:http://baratunde.com/#baratunde keynote speech on day 3 had me in tears.  In one part of his talk he described how he had created “the_swine_flu”:https://twitter.com/the_swine_flu on Twitter and then would follow people on Twitter who were talking about the actual swine flu so that they would get messages that “the_swine_flu” was now following them!  Lol.  His talk was full of interesting examples about how technology and humor could be combined to create beautiful things.</p>

<p>I had read Sandi Metz’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> and couldn’t wait to hear her speak in person.  Finally getting the opportunity was a real treat.  Sandi used <a href="https://github.com/professor/GildedRose">The Gilded Rose</a> kata to illustrate how she would approach refactoring a chunk of nasty legacy code guided by what tests where written.  It was very impressive to hear her talk through her process as she took a mess of conditional statements and turned the code into loosely coupled happiness.</p>

<p>I can’t wait until next year to do it all over again in Atlanta, GA 2015.  Thanks RailsConf / RubyCentral for a great and memorable experience!</p>
