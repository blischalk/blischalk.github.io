SecurityTube Offensive Internet of Things course.</p>

<p>Student ID: IoTE- 778</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>During the
<a href="http://www.securitytube-training.com/online-courses/offensive-internet-of-things-exploitation/index.html">Offensive Internet Of Things Exploitation</a>
course the instructor demonstrates a technique called a “NAND Glitch”
on a Wink Connected Home Hub IoT device.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/WinkHack/WinkAmazon.png" alt="Wink Hub on Amazon" /></p>

<p>This technique allows a root
shell to be acquired on a device which normally does not provide
console access. This post outlines the process I used to replicate the
NAND Glitch as well as discusses some of the “gotchas” that I
encountered along the way.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>The tools that I utilized to perform the NAND Glitch were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wink-PWHUB-WH18-Connected-Home-Hub/dp/B00PV6GAI4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499262776&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=wink+hub">Wink Connected Home Hub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12942">Bus Pirate - v 3.6a</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9556">Bus Pirate Cable</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116">Break Away Headers - Straight</a></li>
  <li>Ubuntu Virtual Machine</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html">Screen</a></li>
  <li>Soldering Iron / Solder</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<p>The steps that I performed to gain a root shell on the Wink Hub device
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disassemble the device</li>
  <li>Solder headers into the UART connections</li>
  <li>Hook up the Bus Pirate</li>
  <li>Use screen to setup the Bus Pirate for UART mode and various other
configurations</li>
  <li>Use screen to connect to the Wink Hub over a UART terminal interface</li>
  <li>Plug in the Wink Hub</li>
  <li>Use a wire to short the 29th pin of the NAND flash chip to ground</li>
  <li>Change the boot arguments to use /bin/sh</li>
  <li>Reboot the hub</li>
  <li>Enjoy root access!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disassembly">Disassembly</h2>

<p>Disassembly of the Wink Hub is pretty straight forward. The device has
4 hex screws that need to be removed. Once these are removed there is
1 black circuit board that makes up the whole device. Pull the board
out and begin the hacking fun.</p>

<img src="/assets/WinkHack/WinkCircuitBoard.JPG" alt="Wink Hub Circuit Board" /></p>

<h2 id="solder-headers">Solder Headers</h2>

<p>The Wink Hub circuit board does not have headers attached for UART
serial interfacing but it does have the pin-outs marked. Simply solder
some headers into the pin-outs using through-hole soldering and you’ll
be set to connect to the device. When I did my soldering I hadn’t
heard of a “Helping Hand Tool” so my soldered pins looked a bit
crooked. This didn’t prevent me from getting a UART terminal
connection but I learned that if I need to do more intricate soldering
in the future, that one of these tools could really come in handy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/WinkHack/WinkUartConnection.JPG" alt="UART Headers" /></p>

<h2 id="hook-up-the-bus-pirate">Hook Up The Bus Pirate</h2>

<p>Hooking up the Bus Pirate is as simple as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect the USB cord from the Bus Pirate device to my laptop</li>
  <li>Connect the GND, MISO, and MOSI connections from the Bus Pirate
to the appropriate TX, RX, and GND connections of the UART headers</li>
  <li>In VirtualBox, select the usb device that was connected</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls /dev/tty*</code> to list tty devices</li>
  <li>Discover that <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/ttyUSB0</code> is the device that will be used</li>
</ul>

<p>** NOTE: I encountered a bit of trouble / confusion with the cable. I
   didn’t know that there were actually different cables available
   with the colored wires organized in different orders. I eventually
   came across this
   <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_I/O_Pin_Descriptions">Wiring Diagram</a>
   which illustrated that the cable that I had purchased actually had
   the colors reversed from what I was seeing in other diagrams.</p>

<h2 id="use-screen-to-configure-bus-pirate-uart-connection">Use Screen to Configure Bus Pirate UART Connection</h2>

<p>Once the Bus Pirate was connected, the next step was to configure the
Bus Pirate. To configure the device I connected using the command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</code></p>

<p>Once connected, I was presented with a prompt for the Bus Pirate. I
believe I actually received a black screen which required me to hit
enter to actually see the prompt. Another thing I learned in this
project is that serial work can be a little flaky. Through this prompt
you configure the Bus Pirate to become a “bridge” which allows UART
communication to pass thru the Bus Pirate and to the device you are
communicating with.</p>

<p>In this prompt I used “m” to configure the mode of the Bus Pirate as
UART. In this configuration wizard all of the defaults are selected
except for a baudrate of 115200 and 3.3v as the voltage of the device.</p>

<p>After the UART mode was configured, I started a “Transparent UART
Bridge” via the macro <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1)</code>.</p>

<p>** NOTE: After setting this up and booting up the Wink Hub, the text on the screen would come out looking like garbage. I did a bunch of Googling and research and it seemed that I also had to set the baudrate using the “b” menu to 115200 prior to setting the mode to UART using the “m” option and going through the wizard. I don’t remember why I had to do this but that seemed to clear up the garbage output.</p>

<h2 id="short-the-nand-flash">Short the NAND Flash</h2>

<p>After the Bus Pirate is all configured and a serial screen connection
is setup, the next step was to actually start up the Wink Hub and
glitch the NAND chip. To perform the glitch I used a piece of wire
with one end touching some of the metal chip housing, and the other
end touching the 29th pin of the NAND flash. It took a few tries to
get to work as I found that I had to create the short in less than a
second after starting up the Wink Hub. Other articles I had found on
the subject said to create the short after ~1 sec but I found that it
needed to happen much sooner than that. As soon as the short worked, I
would receive a terminal prompt after a kernel panic message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/WinkHack/WinkKernelPanic.png" alt="Kernel Panic" /></p>

<h2 id="update-boot-args">Update Boot Args</h2>

<p>At this point we have a shell but not a root shell. By executing
<code class="highlighter-rouge">printenv</code> we see that the arguments used during boot are:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">bootargs=noinitrd console=ttyAM0,115200 rootfstype=ubifs ubi.mtd=5 root=ubi0:rootfs rw gpmi badupdater</code></p>

<p><img src="/assets/WinkHack/WinkPrintenvBootargs.png" alt="printenv" /></p>

<p>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">setenv</code> we can alter the bootargs that are used at startup and
cause the Wink Hub to boot into a root shell. We use the following
commands to accomplish this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">setenv bootargs 'noinitrd console=ttyAM0,115200 rootfstype=ubifs ubi.mtd=5 root=ubi0:rootfs rw gpmi init=/bin/sh';</code></p>

<p>And then reboot with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">nand read ${loadaddr} app-kernel 0x00400000 &amp;&amp; bootm ${loadaddr}</code></p>

<p>How did we know <code class="highlighter-rouge">init=/bin/sh</code> needed to be added? Well, the course sort of glosses over that detail but a quick google turns up <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO-3.html">this</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>The init= Argument

The kernel defaults to starting the init program at boot, which then
takes care of setting up the computer for users via launching getty
programs, running rc scripts and the like. The kernel first looks
for /sbin/init, then /etc/init (depreciated), and as a last resort, it
will try to use /bin/sh (possibly on /etc/rc). If for example, your
init program got corrupted and thus stopped you from being able to
boot, you could simply use the boot prompt init=/bin/sh which would
drop you directly into a shell at boot, allowing you to replace the
corrupted program.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">init=/bin/sh</code> to the bootargs allows for booting directly
into a shell.</p>

<p>How did we know <code class="highlighter-rouge">nand read ${loadaddr} app-kernel 0x00400000 &amp;&amp; bootm
${loadaddr}</code> would reboot?</p>

<p>Well, this is glossed over in the course as well. Looking at the
“app_boot” environment variable though we can get some clues. It
performs <code class="highlighter-rouge">appboot_args</code> which we can guess probably sets up the boot
args that are being modified with /bin/sh. It then proceeds to perform <code class="highlighter-rouge">nand read</code>. What does that do?</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/lentinj/u-boot/blob/master/doc/README.nand">Uboot README</a></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>nand read addr ofs|partition size
Read size bytes from ofs in NAND flash to addr.  Blocks that
are marked bad are skipped.  If a page cannot be read because an
uncorrectable data error is found, the command stops with an error.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So this command reads 0x400000 bytes from the “offset/app-kernel” to
the “loadaddr” location. This seems to be loading the kernel from the
NAND flash into memory. It then proceeds to do <code class="highlighter-rouge">bootm ${loadaddr}</code>.</p>

<p>What does the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bootm</code> command do?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/UBootCmdGroupExec#Section_5.9.4.2.">this documentation</a>:</p>

<p>“bootm - boot application image from memory”</p>

<p>So the proceeding commands combined load the kernel into memory and
then load the kernel. This provides the reboot.</p>
